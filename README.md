# 📝 To-Do List App

This is a simple To-Do List application I built while learning coding.  
It allows users to add, view, and remove tasks.  

Even though I am a beginner, this project is fully functional and can be used in daily life.

## Features
- Add new tasks
- View all tasks
- Remove completed tasks
- Simple and clean interface

Open-source project - feel free to use and improve it.
